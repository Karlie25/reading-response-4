	<h1>Website as Lego</h1>
	<h4>by Karlie Nguyen</h4>

<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Like building your world by using multiple Lego plastic construction pieces, having your website allows you to have the freedom to control how you want to show yourself to the world. Your creativity is not limited by an already set up social media-designed layout. It is like you have your control when you decide to put two Lego bricks together. There is no right or wrong way to randomly try out new shapes or carefully plan what forms you want to build with Lego. The outcomes always reflect your true colors as a designer. It illustrates your identity, possibilities, your ideas, etc. And like building Lego, creating a website is a long process, and we should not rush that process. It takes time to refine and improve.  </p>
